          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>As the title of my page says, I'm Viktoria. I'm a young individual who likes challenges. I find them motivating because they always push our boundaries. The first time I encountered programming, I was in highschool. I found it fascinating, but I didn't really get into it up until we had Web Design for a semester in college. After that I enrolled in a web design course at Edunova, in Osijek. It was everything that I imagined it would be. After that life happened, I started freelancing as a writer and a translator which delayed my plans for building my knowledge in the area of web development. But now I'm here and my motivation is stronger than ever!</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>At this point in my life I'm working real hard to learn the basics of web development, so I could later on build on that knowledge and get even better at it. I like programming, it's like this ever-growing puzzle which has multiple solutions to it, but the final form will look the same every time. At the moment I'm fluent in HTML and CSS. At the web design course I mentioned earlier, due to a minor problem we only scraped the surface of JS, which I'm learning now. I'm practicing with intermediate algorithm challenges. Later on I would like to learn PHP, as well as Python. </p>

            <h3>Knitting</h3>
            <p>I'm a person with many skills. I love photography, cooking, chess. But the one skill I would like to highlight, which doesn't have to do a lot with programming is knitting. Because in a way it <em>does</em> remind me of programming. It's a bunch of loops and if we miss only one of them, it's going to create a huge hole in the whole scarf. Some say that knitting is for old people. I say that it's for anyone who would like to work on their manual skills, or for someone who would like to relax for an hour or two. It might be tough in the beginning, but the more you practice, the easier it gets. Just like programming!</span></p>
